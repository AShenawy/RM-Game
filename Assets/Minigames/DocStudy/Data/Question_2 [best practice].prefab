        different? Personally, I was happy to see more female and LGBTQ+ jammers
        this year, as well as more games addressing gender and other social issues.
        On the other hand, it would be nice if more games did not take the theme
        so literally: a third of the entries I\u2019ve seen literally involved the
        PC increasing in size (which is totally fine, but it\u2019s difficult to
        stand out when so many games are using the same mechanic)."

      Message: Mythologies may have their origins in ancient history (although many
        would say something like The X-Files has its own mythology as well), but
        to me there is a fundamental difference between events that we have reason
        to think actually happened and fictional narratives involving transcendental
        beings. If you are making a game about Greek history, I expect to see a focus
        on the former rather than the latter, although I do acknowledge that the
        line between legends, myths, and historical narratives can often be blurry.
        Sorry to get all professorly on this!

        for me was to be flexible and not hold on to any given idea if it\u2019s
        not working out. For a while, we were stuck trying to make our initial idea
        work; then we realized we would be using our time better by ideating more."

        our game didn\u2019t end up being better than it is, though. Basically, I
