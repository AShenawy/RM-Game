        different? Personally, I was happy to see more female and LGBTQ+ jammers
        this year, as well as more games addressing gender and other social issues.
        On the other hand, it would be nice if more games did not take the theme
        so literally: a third of the entries I\u2019ve seen literally involved the
        PC increasing in size (which is totally fine, but it\u2019s difficult to
        stand out when so many games are using the same mechanic)."

      Message: Mythologies may have their origins in ancient history (although many
        would say something like The X-Files has its own mythology as well), but
        to me there is a fundamental difference between events that we have reason
        to think actually happened and fictional narratives involving transcendental
        beings. If you are making a game about Greek history, I expect to see a focus
        on the former rather than the latter, although I do acknowledge that the
        line between legends, myths, and historical narratives can often be blurry.
        Sorry to get all professorly on this!

        playing collegiate badminton, and one time the school bought these weird
        shuttlecocks that would fly off in random directions and were nearly impossible
        to control. The coach first yelled at us for complaining but then tried it

      Message: Sorry for repeating the obvious, but ultimately the key to balancing
        is testing with as many people as you can. In our prototype for That Fateful

        several more iterations with 100+ testers, and now more people seem happy

        sure that the player\u2019s growth in the game is proportional to their investment
        in it, but also matched by the increase in challenge). Gamathustra has a

        try providing some hints to the player. A puzzle needs to offer guidance,

        could be a sign or note containing a riddle the answer to which tells the
        player what the traps look like on this level. It would be nice to have some
        narrative explanation for why they keep changing appearance, too.'
